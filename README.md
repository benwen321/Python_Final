I decided to analyze NASDAQ and NYSE companies' changes in performance between 2019 and 2020. The dataset I used is here: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alikashif1994/us-listed-companies-finanical-data
Here is some of the relevant terminology: 
Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT): an overview how much profit a company makes before paying off interest and taxes. 
Market Cap: The total value of a publicly traded company
Dividends: a distribution of a company's earnings to it's shareholders

In this project, I explore two questions: 
1. Which industry's EBIT grew the most and shrank the least from 2019 to 2020?
2. What was the overall percentage change in dividends from 2019 to 2020?

I also visualize the following data: 
1. A histogram displaying the number of industries undergoing a certain amount of change in EBIT.
2. A histogram displaying the number of company dividends undergoing a certain amount of change in dividend value. 

I found that the Airline industry earnings shrank the most at -48%, which makes sense because of COVID restrictions. I also found that Mortgage Banks and Brokers earnings grew the most at 18%. Overall, the change in earnings for all companies was -2.5%. 

I also found that the companies who pay dividends had an overall increase in dividend payouts by 5%. This is surprising since companies overall had a shrink in earnings. A possible reason may be that certain industries that are more insulated from COVID tend to pay dividends. More analysis is necessary to be certain.

The following are my data visualizations:

Conclusion: COVID reduced the overall earnings of companies; however, it hit certain industries harder than others, with the worst-hit industry being the airline industry. Yet, even with an overall reduction in earnings, companies that paid dividends were still able to pay higher dividends overall.

# Python_Final
Final for COMP-122
I decided to analyze companies' changes in performance between 2019 and 2020. The dataset I used is here: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alikashif1994/us-listed-companies-finanical-data
Here is some of the relevant terminology: 
Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT): an overview how much profit a company makes before paying off interest and taxes. 
Market Cap: The total value of a publicly traded company
Dividends: a distribution of a company's earnings to it's shareholders

In this project, I explore two questions: 
1. Which industry's EBIT grew the most and shrank the least from 2019 to 2020?
2. What was the overall percentage change in dividends from 2019 to 2020?

I also visualize the following data: 
1. A histogram displaying the number of industries undergoing a certain amount of change in EBIT.
2. A histogram displaying the number of company dividends undergoing a certain amount of change in dividend value.
